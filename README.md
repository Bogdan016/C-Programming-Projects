# C Programming Projects

This is where I've gathered a collection of coding projects that I created while studying C for my exams. 
By working on these projects, I've been able to learn and practice different ideas, which has helped me get better at programming in C and understand it more deeply.

## Projects Included

- **Rock Paper Scissors:** The classic game of decision-making.
- **Hangman:** The popular word-guessing game.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe:** Strategic fun in a timeless game.
- **Guess the Number:** Challenge your guessing skills in this number game.
- **Calculator**
- **Digital Clock**
- **Temperature Converter** 
- **Base Converter** (Decimal, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal)
- **English to Morse Code:** Translate English text into Morse code.

## Development Environment

All these projects were developed using [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/), a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) that supports multiple compilers, including the GCC compiler for C and C++.

Feel free to explore the projects, dive into the code, and have fun with these implementations. If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. These projects are a reflection of my learning journey, and I hope they can be helpful in your own coding adventures.
