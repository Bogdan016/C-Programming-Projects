# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in C


This C console game implements the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in a simple yet engaging way. It allows players to compete against a computer in a series of matches. The game loop prompts players for their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), displays their choices using ASCII art, determines the winner, and keeps track of wins for both the player and computer. The scores are recorded in a file, and players can choose to play again or end the game. The program also incorporates error handling for file operations and provides a visually appealing user experience.

## Features

- Choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- ASCII art representations for each choice.
- Play against the computer.
- Realistic delays for a more immersive experience.
